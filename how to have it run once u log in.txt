C: --> Users --> (the user you use (oops lol)) --> AppData --> Roaming --> Microsoft --> Windows --> Start menu --> Programs --> Start up

Inside Start up...copy and paste the main.bat file that you created earlier

this is enough to have your code automatically run whenever you log in.
(if this is confusing, you could always create a new task at Task scheduler and have your task(run the code) done at start up)
